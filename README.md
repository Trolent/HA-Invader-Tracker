Track [Space Invader](https://www.space-invaders.com/) street art mosaics in Home Assistant. This integration combines data from:

- **[awazleon.space](https://www.awazleon.space/)** — REST API with full invader data per city (status, points, install date)
- **[invader-spotter.art](https://www.invader-spotter.art/)** — News feed for new and reactivated invaders
- **Flash Invader API** — Your personal collection via your account UID

## Overview

Invader Tracker is a comprehensive Home Assistant integration that helps you track, manage, and hunt Space Invader street art mosaics across multiple cities. It automatically monitors new additions, tracks destroyed invaders, detects new cities being invaded worldwide, and keeps you updated on your collection progress.

## Features

**Core Features:**
- **Multi-city tracking** — Monitor invaders across any number of cities
- **Collection management** — Track which invaders you've flashed vs remaining targets
- **Smart notifications** — Get alerted to new invaders and reactivated targets
- **Missed opportunities** — Keep tabs on destroyed invaders you couldn't reach
- **Player profile device** — Your score, rank, cities found, and invaders found in one place
- **Followed players** — Track the players you follow directly in Home Assistant
- **World aggregate device** — Stats summed across all tracked cities + worldwide sensor
- **New city detection** — Sensor that lights up when Space Invader invades a new city

**Technical Features:**
- Single REST call per city (no HTML scraping for invader data)
- News-based new/reactivated detection via invader-spotter.art
- Unified configurable refresh interval (15 min → monthly)
- Smart per-city cache to minimize API calls
- Automatic reload when a new followed player is detected
- Persistent state store across restarts

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Click on **Integrations**
3. Click the three dots in the top right corner
4. Select **Custom repositories**
5. Add `https://github.com/Trolent/HA-Invader-Tracker` with category **Integration**
6. Click **Install**
7. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Trolent/HA-Invader-Tracker/releases)
2. Extract and copy `custom_components/invader_tracker` to your `config/custom_components/` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Quick Start

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **+ Add Integration** and search for "Invader Tracker"
3. Enter your Flash Invader UID
4. Select cities to track
5. Choose your update interval

### Finding Your Flash Invader UID

Your UID is a unique identifier (UUID v4 format) for your Flash Invader account. To locate it:

**Method 1: Network Inspection**
1. Set up a network proxy tool (like mitmproxy, Charles Proxy, or Fiddler)
2. Configure your phone to use the proxy
3. Open the Flash Invader app and refresh your gallery
4. Look for API requests to `api.space-invaders.com`
5. Find the `uid` query parameter in the request URL
6. Format: `XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX`

**Method 2: App Debugging**
1. Enable developer mode on your phone
2. Use Android Studio (Android) or Xcode (iOS) debugging tools
3. Monitor network traffic during app usage

> **Security Note:** Keep your UID private — it grants access to your Flash Invader account data. Never share it publicly.

        to: "on"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
        data:
          title: "New Space Invaders!"
          message: >
            {{ states('sensor.world_new_reactivated') }} new target(s) to flash.

            Total flashed: {{ states('sensor.world_flashed') }}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Integration Shows "Unavailable"

1. Ensure Home Assistant can reach the internet
2. Go to **Settings → System → Logs**, filter by `custom_components.invader_tracker`
3. Check if [awazleon.space](https://www.awazleon.space/) and [invader-spotter.art](https://www.invader-spotter.art/) are accessible

### "Authentication Failed" Error

1. Your UID may have changed — re-obtain it from the Flash Invader app
2. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Invader Tracker → three dots → Edit**
3. Update your UID

### Data Not Updating

1. Check the update interval in options — it may be set to a long value
2. Check logs for "Rate limited" or connection errors
3. Force a refresh: **Developer Tools → Services → `homeassistant.update_entity`**

### "No Cities Found" During Setup

1. awazleon.space may be temporarily unreachable
2. Try again after a few minutes
3. Check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Trolent/HA-Invader-Tracker/issues) for known problems

### Enable Debug Logging

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.invader_tracker: debug
```

Then check **Settings → System → Logs**.
