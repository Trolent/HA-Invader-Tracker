## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Home Assistant development environment
- Git

### Local Development

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub

2. **Clone your fork locally:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/HA-Invader-Tracker.git
   cd HA-Invader-Tracker
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install development dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   pip install pytest pytest-asyncio ruff mypy
   ```

5. **Create a branch for your changes:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=custom_components.invader_tracker

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_models.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Code Style

We use **Ruff** for linting and code formatting. Before committing:

```bash
# Check code style
ruff check custom_components/invader_tracker tests/

# Fix issues automatically
ruff check --fix custom_components/invader_tracker tests/
```

### Type Checking

We use **MyPy** for static type checking:

```bash
# Check types
mypy custom_components/invader_tracker/
```

## Styleguides

### Python Styleguide

All Python code follows [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with Home Assistant conventions:

- Use type hints for all function parameters and returns
- Write docstrings for all classes and public methods
- Keep lines under 100 characters (Ruff configured)
- Use descriptive variable names
- Avoid `except:` or `except Exception:` without specific handling

**Example:**

```python
"""Module docstring."""
from __future__ import annotations

from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

import logging

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from some_module import SomeType

_LOGGER = logging.getLogger(__name__)


class MyClass:
    """Class docstring with purpose."""

    def __init__(self, param1: str, param2: int) -> None:
        """Initialize the class.
        
        Args:
            param1: Description of param1
            param2: Description of param2
        """
        self._param1 = param1
        self._param2 = param2

    def my_method(self, value: str) -> bool:
        """Do something with the value.
        
        Args:
            value: The value to process
            
        Returns:
            True if successful, False otherwise
        """
        # Implementation
        return True
```

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

**Example:**

```
Fix invader status detection in news parser

- Handle both French and English status keywords
- Add unit tests for edge cases
- Fixes #123
```

### Documentation

- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Use clear and concise language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Update the CHANGELOG.md file

## Testing

All new features and bug fixes should include tests.

### Writing Tests

```python
import pytest
from custom_components.invader_tracker.models import Invader, InvaderStatus


class TestInvader:
    """Tests for Invader model."""

    def test_is_flashable_ok(self) -> None:
        """Test is_flashable for OK status."""
        invader = Invader(
            id="PA_001",
            city_code="PA",
            city_name="Paris",
            points=10,
            status=InvaderStatus.OK,
        )
        assert invader.is_flashable is True

    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_async_operation(self) -> None:
        """Test async operations."""
        # Your async test here
        pass
```

## Pull Request Process
